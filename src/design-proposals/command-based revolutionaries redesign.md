## Overview

Revolutionaries are currently already encouraged to compromise command roles by converting them in order to take advantage of their assigned status and assumed trust in a game. This redesign leans into that aspect of the gameplay!
A modest in scope shift from the current revolutionaries gameplay that alters the Head Revolutionary antagonist to be a command exclusive antagonist role available to all command members except the Captain and Head of Security, intended to greatly improve the gameplay for Head Revolutionaries and Revolutionaries and encourage more unique roleplay scenarios.

## Background
I posted this in random-idea-channel:
soo... what if the head revolutionary was a command exclusive (not captain or hos tho ig) traitor role. since... the gamemode already is basically encouraging you to compromise command members and subvert the fact they're typically a trusted role , you would just get a head start which smooths out the early game issues plus it would make late game end sooner and drag on less. Additionally if you've the ability to secure a whole department for the revolution early on that can lead to interesting endgame scenarios with the station actually in war between two distinct areas with clearly drawn frontlines... rather than just chaotically turning into a brawl after you've made enough flashes to convert half or more of the crew and things spiral out of control. And due to each department having its own flavour of things it can do each department would have its own unique flavour as a revolutionary department. since it'd likely enhance the revs power a lot... it could be balanced out by other stuff like requiring all command members to be converted instead of killed... but requiring you to kill all centcom officials on board the station instead before victory is declared. also removing the uplink entirely too I guess, so no syndicomms. also the bonus points here would be that someone who has command experience is less likely to struggle to keep track of and give orders to all of their converted staff meaning the experience of being converted might suck less than it does right now, benefited as it would be by clear meeting spaces and a leader which should really be staying in the area so as not to arise too much suspicion. rather than like... the head rev having no job but wandering around looking for stray and alone crew to convert and thus never being in a coherent place to communicate or plan with

## New Head Revolutionary Implementation

* The Head Revolutionary role is an antagonist role that the Quartermaster, Chief Engineer, Chief Medical Officer, Research Director and Head of Personnel can roll at the game start.
* For balance reasons there should be no more than 1 Head Revolutionary per game.
* Uplinks for the Head Revolutionaries is removed.
* The Head Revolutionary starts the game implanted with a Fake Mindshield and can convert crew to revolutionary via flash. 
* The Head Revolutionary has extrasensory powers which shows them which crew members are Revolutionaries and shows them if a crew member is mindshielded or not. 
* The Head Revolutionary role is locked behind 5 hours in command. 
* Like current Head Revolutionaries: Crew members should never be killed wantonly, nor should the station be damaged by mass destruction or made unoperable in any way. 
* Additionally: Head Revolutionaries MUST keep their job title and defend the station from other antagonists to claim victory in their goals.
* The goal of the Head Revolutionary is to convert the majority of command, depose the captain and kill all Central Command agents, forcing the surrender of the station.
* Can go loud using a psychic command. This allows the Head Revolutionary to issue an order to all revolutionaries at any distance, and activates revolutionaries ability to see each other. This brazen alert will be picked up by Nanotransen's sensors and alert them to your motivations.
* Can promote up to three revolutionaries to the rank of head revolutionary, implanting them with a fake mindshield of their own.

## New Revolutionary Implementation

* Not antagonistic. Expected to be more like a Familiar to the Head Revolutionary role. 
* Can see the identity of the Head Revolutionary next to them.
* After a psychic command is issued, all Revolutionaries share the Head Revolutionary's extrasensory powers. 

## Advantages over existing design

### More intentionality in the early game conversions
Early conversion efforts won't be shaped by a need to get flashes or by the random chance of who you can get alone. You can start out acting around a plan you're forming to try to take over the station, comfortable that you have some security in your department and authority to do so. This means the people you do convert will be converted with an intentionality that is lacking in the current revolutionary gamemode. Hopefully reducing the number of revolutionaries who after conversion just have to sit idle for the rest of the game blending in with no direction or goals or hope until told to "start murdering". 

### Discourage snowballing conversions
Heads of Staff aren't really supposed to be wandering around the station aimlessly with a bag full of flashes for an hour. This attempts to prevent situations where revs get access to large numbers of flashes and simply convert enough people to make conversions in broad open areas viable due to the fact all of the witnesses have been converted already. These large crew wave rushes are often the most chaotic and unreasonable to play against of revolutionary rounds too. There's no viable way to mindshield and deconvert that many people, and they have no real way to break through and end the round either because nobody can get that many weapons. Mutiny should be more fun.

### Storytelling Variety!
This is the BIG one in my opinion. With all of the departments, each possible command member to roll Head Revolutionary is going to have very different tools to achieve their goals. This makes every revolutionaries round really interesting because you can't just know what to expect from them anymore. Setting them well apart from zombies and cosmic cultists.
The CE is Head Revolutionary... And floods the security department with helium to stop the resistance. Or do they alter the entire disposals to network rooms together for stealth insertions and assassinations?
The QM is Head Revoltuionary... And uses their control over the station supplies to attempt to blackmail other heads of staff into siding with them against the Nanotransen employees. Or do they get their salvagers to use kidnap their targets with their shuttle and ransom them to the station?
The CMO is Head Revolutionary... And with the help of the chemist and surgeon, creates a single super soldier, powered by combat drugs and transplanted organs, as an unstoppable assassin to take out their enemies. Or do they use their position to flash everyone who comes in for saving, extracting mindshields from critical condition command staff and secretly taking out the NTR's brain?
The HOP is Head Revolutionary... Acting as a spymaster, their recruits are given fake IDs that let them access other departments and disrupt them or pinch what they need from their supply chains. Or do they get the botanist and chef to poison food for the IAA and make a tider army rife with gatfruits?
The RD is Head Revolutionary... The critical detonation of a thought to be harmless Flora anomaly near security is ordered to distract them while the Revolutionary Gygax Mechs moves on the bridge. Or do they take over the AI and borgs to divert attention and trick command into believing their innocence in the following slaughters?
Promoting other players further expands it, allowing for both delegation of different independant teams or the conversion of a fellow head of staff to launch joint initiatives in the station. The Head Revolutionary can make sure the revolution will live on by appointing co-head revolutionaries and taking the fall for them all if they are found out, leaving the rest to finish the job. Some might believe that removing the head and deconverting their staff will end ther revolution... But the revoltuon can't be stopped so simply after all.

### Roleplay Opportunity
If you're a head revolutionary currently (an antag available with very little playtime as well) you are going to have trouble tracking and giving your team orders if you're not well experienced in it already. This isn't really fun for any of the revolutionaries converted in this round - they have two choices, go insane and just antag on their own without really following orders... not advisable. Or just sit like someone with a completely invisible zombie virus waiting for the revs to push the zombie trigger. Less fun than actually being a zombie infected by far.
Command players are expected to build the skills which will make the game more fun for the converted revolutionaries - managing large teams, planning, ordering people around to do their tasks. Their ability to secure their area as a Head Revolutionary would allow for a lot more roleplay as revolutionaries too. Hushed whispers in the corridors raise suspicions so these exchanges tend to be limited, but a team meeting in the department is expected. Keeping cover from IAAs and other command members might take roleplaying rather than cover just being a given due to none of the converted people doing anything much unless you're spotted and revealed to the station. Likewise, you have the opportunity to form alliances and try to convince others to side with you or get the support of other heads of staff - whom you need to convert, not kill, in order to force Nanotransen to cede their control of your station. Centcomm staff also get a increased focus in the round, bringing them into focus as an objective whereas most other antags focus on command staff instead. Additionally they not only get to have increased importance in the round by spotting suspicious behaviour during department inspections but also getting to be the focal point of roleplaying Nanotransen's goal to hold control of the station. 

## Lore Adjustments
In my opinion the role being command doesn't make it any less revolutionary. The crew of the station are your friends and coworkers! You have no reason to want to overthrow them in any way - you're trying to make their lives better. No, this is your revolution against the evil that is Nanotransen! 
Did it ever strike you as weird you have revolutionaries in a world where Nanotransen would literally just death squad the station anyway if they won? Instead of the existing lore, the new lore would be as follows:
Head Revolutionaries are directly sponsored by Cybersun, who provided the fake mindshield implant which also amplifies their mind control powers. The goal is to use a quirk of Cybersun and Nanotransen corporate agreements and contracts to force Nanotransen to cede the station. Because Cybersun can only assure your independent control of the station if those legal loopholes are jumped through you HAVE to follow the main goals of not killing crew or command staff OR face a death squad because you were an asshole and just shoved plasma through the entire station's air vents.

## Game Design Rationale

### There is no Winning or Losing
In practice the new head revolutionaries are going to be involved in executing their plan for however they can use the department for their secretive machinations and shenanigans, if that is taking the station hostage or staging an awesome battle against security. Players are going to want to be interesting! 

### Maintaining Authenticity
No more utterly pointless pyrrhic victories and being forced to oppose your friends and coworkers. 

### Maximizing Roleplay Potential (Avoid QOL slop)
The changes open up a HUGE world of new potential to roleplay, allowing departments to make more use of lesser used features and abilities of their gameplay and encouraging the revolutionaries to be more organized and roleplay around their fight for a good cause, that being freeing themselves from evil Nanotransen.

### (bonus) Keeping it MRP 
Redesigning the goals and abilities of the revolutionaries and encouraging the use of focused and intentional planning will mean the game no longer compels all of the revolutionary convertees to make bloodthirsty and disorganized roaming anarchy mobs as a result of open revolt.

## Roundflow & Player interaction
The expectations here are that the requirement for the head rev to maintain their position in command and keep things running will hide the threat in the early game while making it a lot more interesting and interactive than current revs early game because of the presence of IAAs who might inspect the department along with the AI and the rest of the command staff. Then as is expected for all major antagonist roles, the last stretch of the game is going to be shaped by them executing whatever plans they've devised.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact
It offers admins a good reason to fax the NTR more and use the Centcomm roles to veil the end of stalemates as a "negotiation with Nanotransen"

# Technical Considerations
Close to zero. This is basically all the stuff existing in game for revs already. Revealing mindshields could require some effort but I imagine this could be tested rapidly.
